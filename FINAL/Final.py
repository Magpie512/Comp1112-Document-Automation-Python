Description:
"""

""" Things ive learned so far is string manipulation, conditional statements, and functions in Python.
Operators, variables, and input/output handling are also some of the basics I have grasped.
Lists and loops are other concepts I have learned to use effectively in my code.

I think the task I want to make is a resume builder. 
I require comments above every block of code to explain its purpose.
