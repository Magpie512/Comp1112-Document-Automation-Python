| **Exponent**                 | ****** | **2 ** 3 = 8**  |                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modulus (or modulo)**      | **%**  | **22 % 8 = 6**  |                                                                                                                |
| **Integer (floor) division** | **//** | **22 // 8 = 2** | **when presented with integer operands, floor division truncates the decimal portion and returns an integer only** |
| **True Division**                | **/**      | **22 / 8 2.75** | **true division returns the floating point quotient**                                                              |
| **Multiplication**               | *****      | **3 * 5 = 15**  |                                                                                                                |
| **Subtraction**                  | **-**      | **5 - 2 = 3**   |                                                                                                                |
| **Addition**                     | **+**      | **2 + 2 = 4**   |                                                                                                                |
## Order of Operations in Python
---
1. () Brackets
2. ** Exponents
3.  * Multiplication , / Division, // Integer Division, % Modulus
4. + Addition, - Subtraction
## Data Types
---
A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type.

| Integers | -2, -1, 0, 1 ,2                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Float    | -1.25 , -1.0 , -0.5, 0.0 , 0.5           |
| Strings  | 'a' , 'aa' , 'aaa' , 'Hello World' , ' ' |
| Boolean  | True / False                             |
| None     | None                                     |
## String Concatenation and Replication
---
+ + Means addition when two operands are ints or floating point numbers
+ + means concatenation (putting together) when the two operands are strings
+ >>> 'alice' + 'henry' results in - alicehenry
	'alice' + 42 results in an error ( cannot convert 'int' object to a Str object implicitly)
+ * means multiplication when the operands are ints or floating point nmbers
+ * means String replication when the operands are one string and one int 
	'alice' * 3 results in 'alicealicealice'

## Course Coding Conventions
---
• Hyphens or underscores are not allowed to be used in variable/function names.  
• Spaces are not allowed in variable/function names.  
• variables/functions cannot begin with a number.  
• Special characters cannot be used in a variable/function name (ex. $)  
• variable/function names are case sensitive  
• By convention, all Python variables/functions should start with a lowercase letter and  
every other word must begin with a capital letter (camelCase)  
	ex. myVariableName  
• Variable/function names should be descriptive to make your code more readable and  
understandable.

## Python Comments
---
Any text following a hash mark (#) is interpreted by Python as a comment and is  
therefore ignored by the interpreter.  
• During this course you will be required to comment each section of code with a  
meaningful comment.  
• The beginning of each program must start with a code header with the following  
information:  
	Name  
	Student Number  
	Date  
	Time  
	Brief description of the code

## The Print() Function
---
• The print() function displays the string value inside the parentheses  
on the screen.  
• print(“hello”) or print(‘hello’) means that Python is calling the print()  
function and a string value is being passed to the function as an  
argument.

## The Input() Function
---
• The input function waits for the user to type some text on the  
keyboard and press ENTER.  
• The input function captures information from the keyboard in String  
format.  
• myName = input() or myName = input(“what is your name”)  
• The above line of script is telling Python to call the input function and  
assign whatever string the user types to the variable myName.

## The Len() Function
---
• The len() function is passed a string as an argument. The function  
returns an integer value of the number of characters in that string

len(‘hello’) returns 5  

firstName = ‘bill’  
print(len(firstName)) returns 4

## Casting Values
---
• The statement 29 + ‘hello’ returns an error because you cannot concatenate an int with a string.  
• To have this operation work we must explicitly change (cast) the int 29 to the string ‘29’.  
• To do this we must call the str() (pronounced “stir”) function  
• str(29) + “hello”

	str(29) returns '29'
Therefore
	'I am' + str(29) + 'years old' returns
			'I am 29 years old'

• The int() and float() functions will evaluate to integer and floating point forms of  
the string value which is passed in as an argument.  
• str(45) evaluates to ‘45’  
• float(‘3.14’) evaluates to 3.14  
• int(‘100’) evaluates to 100  
• The input function always returns a string, so these functions come in handy  
when the user types a number (i.e. a string of the number) which must be used in  
calculations.
