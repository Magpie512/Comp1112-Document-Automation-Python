"""
Practice Problem: Iterate through the first 10 numbers (0–9). In each iteration, print the current number, the previous number, and their sum.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise teaches “State Tracking.” In programming, you often need to remember a value from a previous loop iteration to calculate results in the current one. This is the basis for algorithms like Fibonacci sequences or running totals.
