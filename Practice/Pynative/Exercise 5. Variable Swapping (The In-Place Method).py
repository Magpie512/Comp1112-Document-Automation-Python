"""
Practice Problem: Write a program to swap the values of two variables, a and b, without using a third temporary variable.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise will help you learn about memory efficiency and Python’s special tuple unpacking feature. In other languages like C or Java, you need a temporary variable to swap values safely. In Python, you can swap values in one line without risking data loss.
"""

a = 5
b = 10

print("Before swapping: a =", a, "b =", b)

a, b = b, a

print("After swapping: a =", a, "b =", b)
